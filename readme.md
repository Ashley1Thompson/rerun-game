## Future Updates
We hope to roll out several updates with the game including additional levels/stories, in-game inventory, and email capability to contact our users when updates are expected or released.

## Challenges

The biggest challenges we faced were organzing the database and making sure that multiple functionalities could work together simultaneously (ie timer, sounds, story cards, etc).
