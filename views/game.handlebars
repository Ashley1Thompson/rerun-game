            You wake up on the floor of your living quarters, alarm sirens blaring. Stumbling up to your feet you see the tablet on your desk, informing you that one of the test vials in the science bay has become compromised. You can’t recall where you were before you ended up here, but that appears to be the least of your problems. You’re going to need to make it to that lab to repair the test vial, but according to the readouts you’re seeing the air contamination will render you unconscious within 5 minutes of you leaving the safety of your quarters. Now, time to go repair that vial!</br> You set a 5:00 timer on your watch, press the biometric reader on the side of your door and head out into the hallway.

            The normally peaceful hallways are chaotic with flashing lights and sirens from all directions—it does seem like a bit much for a non-lethal issue. Still, you’re not looking forward to being rendered unconscious again, so you’re keen on getting back to the Science Bay as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, you’re still feeling a bit groggy, and you’re having a bit of trouble remembering the ship’s layout …
